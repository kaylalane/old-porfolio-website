        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) builds pages for websites, and this lesson teaches you how to make a simple webpage. 
        An integrated development environment (IDE), or code editor, isn't required to begin learning HTML. 
        If you don't have an IDE available use your computer's built-in text editor, Notepad on Windows and TextEdit on Mac, or download 
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"> Visual Studio Code </a> for free. 
    </p>

    <h2> HTML Elements</h2>
    <p>
        An HTML page is written with HTML elements containing an opening tag, a closing tag and the information written between those tags. 
        A tag opens with &lttag_name> and closes with &lt/tag_name>, the / is only for the closing bracket. <br>
        For example, <span class="tag">&ltp></span> A simple sentence. <span class="tag">&ltp></span> would create the following on a webpage. 
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>
    <p>Before personalizing your document, you need four basic elements: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="tag">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt </span> is the first line of every HTML document, doesn't need a closing tag and declares the document as an HTML document. </li>
        <li> <span class="tag">&lthtml&gt</span> nestles every other element within itself. <span class="tag">&lthtml&gt</span> is the second line of every document and <span class="tag">&lt/html&gt</span> is the last line of every document. </li>
        <li> <span class="tag">&lthead&gt</span> will be important later but it carries metadata and links to CSS and Javascript files live here. </li>
        <li> <span class="tag">&ltbody&gt</span> carries the bulk of your webpage's information. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> So set up your code as the following to start. </p>
    
    <h3> Opening a .html file </h3>
    <p>
        Find index.html where it's saved on your computer. 
        Double-click to open it in your browser, or right-click, find “Open With” and click your desired browser. 
        The webpage should contain “A simple sentence.” Keep index.html open to view your progress. 
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Building Blocks</h2>
    <p>
        Notice the tag <span class="tag">&ltp></span>? Content within the <span class="tag">&ltp></span> tag shows up as paragraph text, like the words you're seeing now. 
    </p>

    <p> Let's add a couple of headings with the <span class="tag">&lth1&gt</span> tag before the paragraph. </p>

    <p class="code">
        <span class="tag">&lth1&gt</span> Moby Dick <span class="tag">&lt/h1&gt</span> <br>
        <span class="tag">&lth2&gt</span> Typee <span class="tag">&lth2&gt</span> <br>
	    <span class="tag">&lth3&gt</span> Benito Cereno <span class="tag">&lth3&gt</span>
    </p>
    
    <p> Save the file and refresh index.html in your browser. </p>

    <div class="tip"> 
        <h4>Tip </h4>
        <p>If all your titles look the same, check that you included the / in the closing tag. </p>
    </div>
